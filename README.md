The work in this reposity is completed coursework from a Computer Vision Class. The Outline for each notebook was given as an assignment and I was tasked with implementing and understanding all of the concepts/algorithms. The professor for this class is Roy Shilkrot and he is the author of the assignment ideas and outlines for each notebook.
